# Client SDK

We have created a package of client software for developing client applications that connect to the Sifchain software stack and enables you to query state or perform transactions without requiring a full installation of Sifnode or a browser.

A summary including detailed information on supported APIs, Client Methods, and Wallet Methods, please refer to our [README](https://github.com/Sifchain/ClientSDK/blob/main/README.md). 

Please feel free to explore the [entire repo](https://github.com/Sifchain/ClientSDK) for additional information that will help to integrate with Sifnode!
