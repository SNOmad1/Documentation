# Rewards Programs

## Special Programs

### Sif's Expansion Liquidity Mining Program

* Sifchain will maintain a \~300% Total APR across 6 pools until either: Margin Trading is released, the community decides to end the program via the monthly vote, or the program needs to be halted (due to market and/or economic conditions).
  * ROWAN:ATOM will maintain a \~300% APR for the entire duration of the program.
  * The Sifchain community will decide via a vote every 4 weeks which other four pools will get the \~300% APR for the upcoming 4 week period. Because the vote occurs every 4 weeks, these pools may change from 4 week period to 4 week period.
  * When voting for the 4 additional \~300% APR pools, these votes will be weighted.  More details on this process will come if this proposal passes.
* All other pools will have \~100% APR for the duration of the program.
* Every month until Margin Trading is released, the community will vote to extend, modify, or end this inflationary liquidity mining program. This will allow the community to view historical inflation and price movements and project the same data points in the future. &#x20;

**Important notes on this program:**

* For the initial implementation of this program, there will be no vesting constraints on the rewards that are earned from this program. However, we will be looking into implementing a time-specific vesting schedule which will reward those for keeping their liquidity pooled for longer durations. This decision is due to time constraints, the desire to continue rewards when Sif’s Bloom ends, and other team priorities (like Margin Trading and Omni-EVM).
* Analysis will also be done to determine if the \~300% total APR for primary pools and \~100% APR for all other pools can come from a combination of swap fees, rewards from other projects, and inflation. Inflation would be used to cover any APR not generated by swap fees or rewards from other projects.
* All existing liquidity in these pools will be eligible to earn rewards (for both the 300% APR voted pools and the ‘all-other’ 100% APR pools). For example, this means that once launched, all existing liquidity in the ROWAN:ATOM pool will start to earn rewards (as well as newly added liquidity).&#x20;
* Sifchain's IL Mitigation feature WILL be in place for this new program as well. See more details here on this:
  * We have implemented an Impermanent Loss (IL) Mitigation. If a user realizes IL, the user will continue to earn rewards based on the realized IL amount. These values are based on the Rowan value of a user’s add. For example, imagine a user deposits 50K Rowan and 50K Rowan worth of USDT for a total of 100K Rowan worth of assets into a Sifchain liquidity pool. Let’s say this amount drops to 80K worth of Rowan due to price fluctuations. The user removes all 80K Rowan worth of assets. That user will continue to earn LM rewards based off of the 20K Rowan worth of assets that was lost due to IL (the 20k here is called the ‘IL amount’). The IL amount ONLY comes into play if a user removes their liquidity and realizes IL. If that user were to add additional liquidity after realizing this IL, their LM Reward eligibility amount would be the sum of their IL amount + any added liquidity amounts.

**Important notes on voting for the 5 pool choices:**

* Send a transaction to address sif1seftxu8l6v7d50ltm3v7hl55jlyxrps53rmjl8.
* This transaction should be for .1 ROWAN
* In the memo field, you will indicate the 5 pools you are voting for, seperated by commas. Please follow the below directions **exactly** when inputting information into the memo field:
  * List ONLY 4 tokens you are voting for. These 4 tokens should be by their token symbol as listed within the Sifchain DEX, separated by commas, like this: TKN,TKN,TKN,TKN,TKN. An example of this is as follows: ETH,UST,USDC,JUNO,LUNA
  * You can list the same token all 5 times if that is what you desire. Example: ETH,ETH,ETH,ETH,ETH.
  * If you list the 5 tokens in any other format than specified above, there is no guarantee that it will be counted. In order to ensure a successful vote, follow the above format **exactly**.
  * Votes are limited 1 per Sifchain address. So if you submit two transactions, only 1 will be counted.

**Sif's Expansion Dates**

* Phase 1: 11/22 - 12/21
* Phase 2: 12/21 - 1/17

## Ongoing Programs

### Block Rewards

Block rewards are earned and distributed to Validators and delegators to existing validators in real-time as blocks are processed. To earn these rewards, you must be a validator and acting member in consensus, OR a delegator to a validator and acting member in consensus. For more information on this, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators#block-rewards).

### Pool Rewards

Pool rewards are given to liquidity providers as a way to incentivize users to add liquidity to our system. They are earned each time a user swaps in/out of the associated pool. You must have liquidity in a pool and for swap activity to be occurring in that pool to earn pool rewards. For more information, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/core-concepts/liquidity-pool#liquidity-provider-income-determination).
