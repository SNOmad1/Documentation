# Rewards Programs

## Special Programs

### Sif's Harvest: Liquidity Mining Program

We are excited to inform you of a new Liquidity Mining program launching October 4th, 2021, aptly named **Sif’s Harvest**. We have learned a lot from running our previous reward programs, and we designed this one with very careful consideration to ensure we were going to achieve the results that will help propel Sifchain.

Our goal for this program is to put daily active user count on an exponential growth curve while encouraging adding of liquidity across all pools by offering great APY that is spread over a 6 week time-frame. We will encourage users to frequently engage in DEX activity by allowing them to claim and re-pool their rewards at no penalty to realize compounded gains.

**Key facts around this upcoming Liquidity Mining program are below. We are simplifying the process, while enabling participants to earn more:**

1. Liquidity Providers will have _no_ lockup period
2. Claim rewards at any time \(Payouts for claims made weekly on Fridays\)
3. LPs will expect ~345% APY
4. All pools are eligible
5. The LM program will run for six \(6\) weeks

**Impermanent Loss Mitigation**  
We have implemented an Impermanent Loss \(IL\) Mitigation. If a user realizes IL, the user will continue to earn rewards based on the realized IL amount. These values are based on the Rowan value of a user’s add. For example, imagine a user deposits 50K Rowan and 50K Rowan worth of USDT for a total of 100K Rowan worth of assets into a Sifchain liquidity pool. Let’s say this amount drops to 80K worth of Rowan due to price fluctuations. The user removes all 80K Rowan worth of assets. That user will continue to earn LM rewards based off of the 20K Rowan worth of assets that was lost due to IL \(the 20k here is called the ‘IL amount’\). The IL amount ONLY comes into play if a user removes their liquidity and realizes IL. If that user were to add additional liquidity after realizing this IL, their LM Reward eligibility amount would be the sum of their IL amount + any added liquidity amounts.

**FAQs:**

* **Which pools are eligible for me to earn rewards from?** EVERY pool listed in the Sifchain DEX!
* **When does this program start?**  It starts on October 3rd 5:30pm PST. This means that you will earn rewards on any and all liquidity you add starting on October 4th and going until the end of the program.
* **When does the program end?** The program will run for 6 weeks. This means its end date will be: November 12th, 2021.
* **How do I earn these rewards?** Simply add liquidity to any of our pools and that is it. Visit our Rewards page in the DEX to watch your rewards grow. 
* **How do I claim my rewards? Are there any penalties for claiming them?** You can claim your rewards by going into the Sifchain DEX and going to the Rewards tab. Here you will be able see how many rewards you have earned and the ability to claim them. No, you will not be penalized for claiming them! In fact, we are encouraging users to claim these rewards each week so they can re-deposit them into the liquidity pool to earn even more rewards!
* **When are claimed rewards paid out?** Claims will be processed each week and distribution will occur on Friday evenings PST. When these rewards are distributed, they will get automatically sent to your wallet. You are now free to use these any way you see fit \(like adding them back into a liquidity pool!\). 
* **How much am I expected to earn by participating in this program?** We are aiming at a 345% APY. We will adjust the reward pool to ensure we stay around this percentage.  
* **What if I have pending rewards in the .42 Liquidity Mining Program and Sif's Harvest Liquidity Mining program?** If you want to claim your rewards, you will need to claim ALL of your rewards \(hence why there is only 1 claim button now\). 
* **If I add any liquidity before the program start, will that be eligible for these rewards?** No, only liquidity adds from the start of the program and until the end date of the program will be eligible to earn rewards.

### .42 Liquidity Mining Program

With the introduction of .42 and IBC within Sifchain, we have decided to launch a special Liquidity Mining program \(one that we are calling the 'IBC LM program'\). The rules, and important details of this program are as follows:

* We will be using the same concepts of our .39 Liquidity Mining Program \(as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)\). This explains our usage of tickets and ticket multipliers,  a global bucket, claiming your rewards, impacts of withdrawing liquidity, and IL protection.
* The total global bucket amount for this program will be 10,000,000 ROWAN. This bucket will be used as the single bucket across all eligible pools.
* The eligibility window will be set to 6 weeks, starting on August 24, 2021. This means any liqudity added to our eligible pools within this time frame will earn rewards.
* The full maturation time period is also set to 6 weeks as well. 
  * For example:
    * If you add on eligible liquidity on day 1, you will earn rewards for 6 weeks and full maturation will occur at 6 weeks.
    * If you add eligible liquidity on week 5, you will earn rewards for 1 week, and still have 6 week maturation period from the time you added.
* The eligible pools are all CosmosSDK tokens on IBC \(ex: Atom, DVPN, AKT, etc.\). This means if you add any liquidity to ANY of these pools, you will be eligible to earn rewards.

**Summary of eligibility requirements:**

* A user will be eligible to receive these rewards IF they add liquidity to any Sifchain &lt;&gt; Cosmos Asset pool. As we add new Comos tokens to the DEX, those will also automatically be included as well. 
* A user will be eligible to receive these rewards IF they add liquidity during the eligibility window. This window is set for 6 weeks starting on August 24, 2021.
* A user will earn full maturity of their rewards once they keep the associated liquidity in 6 weeks.
* If a user removes liquidity from an IBC pool, this will be treated as a normal remove liquidity event and subject to our ticket burning logic \(as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)\). 
* If a user withdraws ANY of their liquidity across ANY pool and is receiving any rewards from the legacy .39 program, they will be subject to forfeiting all their .39 rewards \(as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)\). 

**Claiming**

* Come the 2nd week of the program, users will be eligible to claim their rewards in the DEX UI. They can do this by navigating to the 'Rewards' page in the DEX and click the claim button. 
* All claimed rewards will be paid out at the end of the week. This means that if you were to submit a claim request for your claimable rewards, that request will be processed on Friday or Saturday of that week, unless specified by the Sifchain team. 

**Recommendations:**

* You should not remove ANY liquidity across ANY pool if you are receiving .39 rewards. If you do so, you are subject to the DQ rules of that program.
* We HIGHLY recommend that anyone that is interested in the new IBC LM program to pool new liquidity. Do not remove any as-is liquidity to move to the new IBC LM eligible pools.

## Ongoing Programs

### Block Rewards

Block rewards are earned and distributed to Validators and delegators to existing validators in real-time as blocks are processed. To earn these rewards, you must be a validator and acting member in consensus, OR a delegator to a validator and acting member in consensus. For more information on this, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators#block-rewards).

### Pool Rewards

Pool rewards are given to liquidity providers as a way to incentivize users to add liquidity to our system. They are earned each time a user swaps in/out of the associated pool. You must have liquidity in a pool and for swap activity to be occurring in that pool to earn pool rewards. For more information, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/core-concepts/liquidity-pool#liquidity-provider-income-determination).
