# Rewards Programs

## Special Programs

### Sif's Fields of Gold Trading Competition

We would like to announce the **Sif’s Fields of Gold** trading competition that will kick-off on October 25th!\
\
Our goal for this program is to continue to put daily user count on an exponential growth curve while encouraging users to swap in both high volume amounts and/or high numbers of individual transactions. We are encouraging users to execute both in high volume swaps, as well as in high number of swaps by having two different scoreboards with dedicated reward pools.\
\
This competition will encourage anyone and everyone to swap on the Sifchain DEX, compete, and earn $ROWAN by doing so! This competition will ideally generate high values of system income paid to liquidity providers in the form of swap fees, and to node operators and delegators as transaction fees. So make sure you add liquidity, stake, or do both!

We are also going to have additional reward pools for users who swap the most against specific pools. These are going to be sponsored by the relevant token’s project and the associated rewards will be paid out in their token! This means you can earn $ROWAN and other tokens by participating in this competition! More on these sponsorships below!\
\
Finally, we are planning to run a multi-day live stream with this event! The live stream will include various discussions with Sifchain Core team members. If you are interested in joining the live stream, please sign-up via the link below to be notified of the stream schedule and various discussion topics!

2. The competition will last for 30 days: From October 25th - November 23rd.
3. There will be two different leaderboards:
   1. Based on total volume swapped over these 30 days (normalized in USDT).
   2. Based on total number of swaps over these 30 days
4. Users will be able to see their position in each leaderboard via a scoreboard on the Sifchain DEX.
5. The top 30 addresses in each leaderboard will be awarded prizes.
6. The total reward pool for the Leaderboard - based on Total Volume: 3,000,000 ROWAN
7. The total reward pool for the Leaderboard - based on Total Number of Swaps: 1,000,000 ROWAN
8. The payout determination for the ‘Leaderboard - based on Total Volume’ will be based upon the percentage of the pie each user in the top 30 owns of that top 30. For example:
   1. ![](<../../.gitbook/assets/Screen Shot 2021-10-20 at 11.47.33 AM.png>)
9. The payout determination for the ‘Leaderboard - based on Number of Swaps’ will be pre-determined by placement for those in the top 30. The payout structure is as follows:

More details on this to come closer to the launch of the competition!
12. We encourage users to keep adding liquidity to our pools to earn swap fees from this competition.
13. We encourage users to keep staking and delegating ROWAN to earn transaction fees during this competition.

### Sif's Harvest & Sif's Bloom: Liquidity Mining Program

We are excited to inform you of a new Liquidity Mining program launching October 4th, 2021, aptly named **Sif’s Harvest**. We have learned a lot from running our previous reward programs, and we designed this one with very careful consideration to ensure we were going to achieve the results that will help propel Sifchain.

Our goal for this program is to put daily active user count on an exponential growth curve while encouraging adding of liquidity across all pools by offering great APY that is spread over a 6 week time-frame. We will encourage users to frequently engage in DEX activity by allowing them to claim and re-pool their rewards at no penalty to realize compounded gains.

**Key facts around this upcoming Liquidity Mining program are below. We are simplifying the process, while enabling participants to earn more:**

1. Liquidity Providers will have _no_ lockup period
2. Claim rewards at any time (Payouts for claims made weekly on Fridays)
3. LPs will expect a highly-competitive APY percentage
4. All pools are eligible
5. The LM program will run for six (6) weeks

**Impermanent Loss Mitigation**\
We have implemented an Impermanent Loss (IL) Mitigation. If a user realizes IL, the user will continue to earn rewards based on the realized IL amount. These values are based on the Rowan value of a user’s add. For example, imagine a user deposits 50K Rowan and 50K Rowan worth of USDT for a total of 100K Rowan worth of assets into a Sifchain liquidity pool. Let’s say this amount drops to 80K worth of Rowan due to price fluctuations. The user removes all 80K Rowan worth of assets. That user will continue to earn LM rewards based off of the 20K Rowan worth of assets that was lost due to IL (the 20k here is called the ‘IL amount’). The IL amount ONLY comes into play if a user removes their liquidity and realizes IL. If that user were to add additional liquidity after realizing this IL, their LM Reward eligibility amount would be the sum of their IL amount + any added liquidity amounts.

**FAQs:**

* **Which pools are eligible for me to earn rewards from?** EVERY pool listed in the Sifchain DEX!
* **When does this program start?** It starts on October 3rd 5:30pm PST. This means that you will earn rewards on any and all liquidity you add starting on October 4th and going until the end of the program.
* \*\*When does the program end? \*\*The program will run for 6 weeks. This means its end date will be: November 12th, 2021.
* **How do I earn these rewards?** Simply add liquidity to any of our pools and that is it. Visit our Rewards page in the DEX to watch your rewards grow.
* **How do I claim my rewards? Are there any penalties for claiming them?** You can claim your rewards by going into the Sifchain DEX and going to the Rewards tab. Here you will be able see how many rewards you have earned and the ability to claim them. No, you are not penalized for claiming early! With that being said: If you claim on Wednesday (for example), it locks your rewards to be claimed for that week at that amount. Your non-pending claim rewards will continue to accrue, but those rewards will not be claimable until the current pending claim has been paid out. SO if you are wanting to maximize your rewards that you are claiming each week, you should claim come **Friday early morning PST (before 8am PST)**
* **When are claimed rewards paid out?** Claims will be processed each week and distribution will occur on Friday evenings PST. When these rewards are distributed, they will get automatically sent to your wallet. You are now free to use these any way you see fit (like adding them back into a liquidity pool!).
* **How much am I expected to earn by participating in this program?** We are aiming at a 345% APY. We may increase the reward pool in hopes to stay around this percentage. This will be based upon various market factors, strategic goals, and how Sifchain progresses over the duration of this program. The goal is to stay at a highly-competitive APY percentage to attract and maintain liquidity providers, while ensuring to build value in Sifchain and the $ROWAN token.
* **What if I have pending rewards in the .42 Liquidity Mining Program and Sif's Harvest Liquidity Mining program?** If you want to claim your rewards, you will need to claim ALL of your rewards (hence why there is only 1 claim button now).
* \*\*If I add any liquidity before the program start, will that be eligible for these rewards? \*\*No, only liquidity adds from the start of the program and until the end date of the program will be eligible to earn rewards.

### .42 Liquidity Mining Program

With the introduction of .42 and IBC within Sifchain, we have decided to launch a special Liquidity Mining program (one that we are calling the 'IBC LM program'). The rules, and important details of this program are as follows:

* We will be using the same concepts of our .39 Liquidity Mining Program (as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)). This explains our usage of tickets and ticket multipliers, a global bucket, claiming your rewards, impacts of withdrawing liquidity, and IL protection.
* The total global bucket amount for this program will be 10,000,000 ROWAN. This bucket will be used as the single bucket across all eligible pools.
* The eligibility window will be set to 6 weeks, starting on August 24, 2021. This means any liqudity added to our eligible pools within this time frame will earn rewards.
* The full maturation time period is also set to 6 weeks as well.
  * For example:
    * If you add on eligible liquidity on day 1, you will earn rewards for 6 weeks and full maturation will occur at 6 weeks.
    * If you add eligible liquidity on week 5, you will earn rewards for 1 week, and still have 6 week maturation period from the time you added.
* The eligible pools are all CosmosSDK tokens on IBC (ex: Atom, DVPN, AKT, etc.). This means if you add any liquidity to ANY of these pools, you will be eligible to earn rewards.

**Summary of eligibility requirements:**

* A user will be eligible to receive these rewards IF they add liquidity to any Sifchain <> Cosmos Asset pool. As we add new Comos tokens to the DEX, those will also automatically be included as well.
* A user will be eligible to receive these rewards IF they add liquidity during the eligibility window. This window is set for 6 weeks starting on August 24, 2021.
* A user will earn full maturity of their rewards once they keep the associated liquidity in 6 weeks.
* If a user removes liquidity from an IBC pool, this will be treated as a normal remove liquidity event and subject to our ticket burning logic (as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)).
* If a user withdraws ANY of their liquidity across ANY pool and is receiving any rewards from the legacy .39 program, they will be subject to forfeiting all their .39 rewards (as outlined [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/resources/rewards-programs/additional-information-.39-lm-vs-program)).

**Claiming**

* Come the 2nd week of the program, users will be eligible to claim their rewards in the DEX UI. They can do this by navigating to the 'Rewards' page in the DEX and click the claim button.
* All claimed rewards will be paid out at the end of the week. This means that if you were to submit a claim request for your claimable rewards, that request will be processed on Friday or Saturday of that week, unless specified by the Sifchain team.

**Recommendations:**

* You should not remove ANY liquidity across ANY pool if you are receiving .39 rewards. If you do so, you are subject to the DQ rules of that program.
* We HIGHLY recommend that anyone that is interested in the new IBC LM program to pool new liquidity. Do not remove any as-is liquidity to move to the new IBC LM eligible pools.

## Ongoing Programs

### Block Rewards

Block rewards are earned and distributed to Validators and delegators to existing validators in real-time as blocks are processed. To earn these rewards, you must be a validator and acting member in consensus, OR a delegator to a validator and acting member in consensus. For more information on this, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators#block-rewards).

### Pool Rewards

Pool rewards are given to liquidity providers as a way to incentivize users to add liquidity to our system. They are earned each time a user swaps in/out of the associated pool. You must have liquidity in a pool and for swap activity to be occurring in that pool to earn pool rewards. For more information, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/core-concepts/liquidity-pool#liquidity-provider-income-determination).
