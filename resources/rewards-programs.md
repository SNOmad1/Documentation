# Rewards Programs

## Special Programs

### Liquidity Mining Program

Liquidity Mining rewards are given to users who provide liquidity to liquidity pools. Liquidity pools offer capital for users to swap with. They include ROWAN and other assets \(e.g. ETH, wBTC, USDT, etc.\). Tokens added to a liquidity pool can be removed at any time.

Liquidity mining rewards are rewards given for adding liquidity in the Sifchain [liquidity pool subsystem](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/liquidity-providers). More detailed information on this program will be added here soon!

### Validator Subsidy Program

Validator Subsidy rewards are given to users who stake or delegate liquidity to the validator subsystem. Validators secure all transactions on Sifchain via [Tendermint Consensus](https://docs.sifchain.finance/core-concepts/sifchain-consensus). Only ROWAN can be staked or delegated in this subsystem. More detailed information about this program will be added here soon!

### Community Token Giveaway

The eligibility for our [Community Token Giveaway](%20https://medium.com/sifchain-finance/community-distribution-tokens-5dc4b184948e) is now closed, but have not been distributed yet. Please refer back here for updates on distribution status. 

## Ongoing Programs

### Block Rewards

Block rewards are earned and distributed to Validators and delegators to existing validators in real-time as blocks are processed. To earn these rewards, you must be a validator and acting member in consensus, OR a delegator to a validator and acting member in consensus. For more information on this, please refer [here](https://docs.sifchain.finance/roles/validators#block-rewards).

### Pool Rewards

Pool rewards are given to liquidity providers as a way to incentivize users to add liquidity to our system. They are earned each time a user swaps in/out of the associated pool. You must have liquidity in a pool and for swap activity to be occurring in that pool to earn pool rewards.
