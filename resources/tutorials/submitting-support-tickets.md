# Submitting Support Tickets

At Sifchain, we use Github to manage our support ticketing system. This helps us track issues, as well as enabling engineers to have everything they need to resolve your issue efficiently.

## Open a ticket on Github&#x20;

Follow [this link ](https://github.com/Sifchain/Support-Tickets)to access the ticketing system - you will need to create an account.

Then:

* Click on “Issues”.
* Open a ticket by clicking on “New Issue”.
* Select the most appropriate template:&#x20;
  * Liquidity Mining / Rewards
  * Import / Export
  * User Interface
* Add a title, edit the template to add all the relevant information to your case. This will allow the engineers to efficiently solve your issue.
* Submit the issue.
* Relax, and monitor the issue for updates :D
